# adbook-report-api
This is sample Python code for programmatically pulling reports from the Fattail/Adbook API. See inline comments for explanations. If this library is useful to anyone I would love to hear from you. Also feel free to reach out if you're trying to use this and hitting a problem. I'm not the world's foremost SOAP expert, but I'll see what I can to do help.
